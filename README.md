#A calendar of prophetick time, drawn by an express Scripture-line, from the creation to the new Jerusalem demonstrating that the famous apocalyptick vision of the witnesses slain, truly explained, did determine at the Reformation begun by Luther, but that the time of their prophecy in sackcloth will not expire till the year 1697 : on which shall follow the fall of the tenth of the city Babylon in its ten horns, or kings separated intirely from it : and the Turkish woe passed, and the seventh trumpet sounding, there shall be a most loud and publick ministration of the Gospel, beyong any time, since the apostles, described as seven voices, or the seven thunders unsealed, Apoc. 14 : and at the year 1727 shall begin the final destruction of the beast by the vials, accomplished at the year 1772, in the New Jerusalem briefly described : with a postscript freeing this computation from objections rising from the sentiments of the most pious and learned expositor Dr. More, especially in his late Arithmetica Apocalyptica, and his answer to S.E.#
